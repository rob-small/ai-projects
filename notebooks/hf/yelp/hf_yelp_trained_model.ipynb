Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\\\\n\\\\nBottom line, this place sucks.

I then had the deer medallions and the cheesecake to finish.  Everything tasted REALLY great and the prices were reasonable.  If you are in the area this is a MUST visit restaurant.\n",

      "Review Text Oh Lush how I love thee. I was fortunate to discover Lush in 2000 while traveling in Sweden. At that time I bought as much as I could fit into my backpack and brought it back to the States! Yes I was a Lush smuggler.Every time I returned to Europe I bought all the Lush products I could. I think since 2000 I have been to a Lush store in over 12 countries! Even Iceland had a store before the US did!\\nSince I was traveling a decent amount my favorite product was and still is their shampoo bars. They are great to pack since they don't take up much space and you don't have to worry about the liquid ban!\\n\\nOne negative thing is that Lush will discontinue items- including my favorite shampoo bar ever- Jumping Juniper =(\\n\\nThere is an amazing sale after Christmas where their poxed sets are buy 1 get 2 free!!!\\n\\nThe only reason I can't give the store 5 stars is the odor. Some people really like the smell in the store, but for me it is overpowering and I have to leave the store for a few min. while shopping in order to breathe. A larger store doesn't smell quite as strong as the FS store. I think more ventilation is in order. \\n\\nBut overall go forth and shop!\n",
